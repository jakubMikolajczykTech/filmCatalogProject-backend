# Movie Catalog Project

## Project Overview

The Movie Catalog Project is a web application designed to allow users to add movies to a catalog using a form. Additionally, the application provides user registration and the ability to comment on shared content. The project primarily utilizes React.js for the frontend and Node.js for the backend, with PostgreSQL as the database of choice.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend (React.js):
- **React.js**: Used for building the user interface.
- **React Router**: For managing routes (routing).
- **Axios or Fetch API**: For making HTTP requests to the server.

### Backend (Node.js):
- **Node.js**: For creating the server.
- **Express.js**: For creating APIs and managing routes.
- **Sequelize or TypeORM**: For handling the PostgreSQL database.
- **Bcrypt.js**: For hashing and verifying user passwords.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For user authentication and authorization.
- **Multer**: For handling file uploads (e.g., movie thumbnails).

### Database:
- **PostgreSQL**: For storing information about movies, user accounts, and comments.
- **pg-promise or Sequelize (depending on the ORM choice)**: For handling SQL queries with Node.js.

### Authentication and Authorization:
- **Passport.js**: For handling authentication strategies (local strategy, JWT, etc.).
- **Middleware for authorization**: To control access to certain features only for logged-in users.

### Comment Handling:
- **Creating comment models**: To store information about comments in the database.
- **API endpoints for managing comments**: For adding, deleting, and editing comments.
- **Handling relationships between movies, users, and comments**.

### Handling Multimedia Files:
- **Multer (or another library)**: For uploading and storing movie thumbnails or other media.

### Security:
- **Helmet.js**: For securing the application against XSS attacks and other threats.
- **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**: For controlling API access from different sources.

### Testing:
- **Jest or Mocha**: For backend code testing.
- **React Testing Library or Enzyme**: For testing React components.

### Dependency Management and Environment:
- **npm or Yarn**: For managing packages and dependencies.
- **.env**: For storing sensitive data like API keys or secret tokens.

### Hosting and Deployment:
- **Hosting platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, Netlify, or Vercel)**: For deploying the application.
- **Database as a service or VPS server for hosting the database**.

### Monitoring and Logging:
- **Monitoring and error logging tools like Sentry or Rollbar**.

### UI Framework (optional):
- **Bootstrap, Material-UI, or another UI framework** for building the user interface.

### Other Development and Debugging Tools:
- **Visual Studio Code or other IDEs**.
- **Browser developer tools** for frontend debugging.
